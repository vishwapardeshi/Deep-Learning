# Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

This 3 week course introduces best-practices for Deep Learning. It helped me familiarize myself with Initialization, L2 and 
Dropout Regularization, Batch Normalization, gradient checking, and a variety of optimization algorithms.

## Course Outline 

1. Week 1: Practical aspects of Deep Learning
2. Week 2: Optimization algorithms
3. Week 3: Hyperparameter tuning, Batch Normalization and Programming Frameworks
