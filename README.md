# Deep Learning Specialization

This contains projects which are a part of the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera taught by Andrew Ng presented by deeplearning.ai. 

## Motivation
According to Forbes (2018), 2.5 quintillion (10 ^ 18) bytes of data is generated per day as a result of which 90% of all data has been generated in the last two years alone. This data holds value - a goldmine of opinions & unstructured information has the potential to transfer every domain - healthcare to finance. 

Deep Learning can harness the power of big data which has been made possible due to the high computation power available now. So, having worked with convolutinal neural networks, capsule networks - a variant of CNN, etc, Deep Learning seems like the next natural step. I wanted to dabble with technology that has produced state-of-the-art results with highly complicated problems such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

## Specialization Outline
This is a five course specialization that introduces Deep Learning through various case studies in healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing.

The five courses are:
1. Neural Networks & Deep Learning
2. Improving Deep Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Sequence Models

Detailed explanation can be found in course-specific folder.
